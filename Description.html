        <div id="blah"> Set within a year after the events of Batman Begins (2005), Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, 
        and new District Attorney Harvey Dent successfully begin to round up the criminals that plague 
        Gotham City, until a mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind known only as "The Joker" appears 
        in Gotham, creating a new wave of chaos. Batman's struggle against The Joker becomes deeply personal, 
        forcing him to "confront everything he believes" and improve his technology to stop him. A love triangle
        develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent, and Rachel Dawes.â€”Leon Lombardi</div>
